    "* the value of the $\\alpha$ parameter\n",

    "The connectivity array describes which carbon atoms are connected _via_ a double bond. This is essential, since it determines which entries in the H&uuml;ckel matrix are nonzero!\n",
    "As an example, for the ethene molecule $[1, 2]$ would be the connectivity array. For the butadiene molecule one would instead have $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]$ which means that atom $1$ is connected to atom $2$ by a double bond, atom $2$ and $3$ are connected by a single bond and atom $3$ and $4$ are again connected by a double bond.\n",
    "Why so? Because butadiene has 4 carbon atoms, hence only two double bonds can be present. Since these have to be _alternating_ carbon $2$ and carbon $3$ must be connected by a single bond.\n",
    "To help with determining the connectivity array, draw the molecule and number all carbon atoms.\n",
